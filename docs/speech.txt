Problem: the import path is misspelled and/or the package isn't installed. The line has "langchain_communnity" (double n) which is wrong — and modern LangChain exposes TextLoader under langchain.document_loaders.

Fix (edit the active file):

If you actually meant a community package, either install the correct package or use the correct module name. Common commands:

Install LangChain (recommended):

pip install -U langchain
If you need a community contrib package (check exact name on PyPI):

pip install langchain-community
Troubleshooting tips

Make sure you installed into the same Python interpreter VS Code is using (select interpreter: Ctrl+Shift+P → Python: Select Interpreter).
Verify installation in the integrated terminal:
python -c "import langchain; print(langchain.version)"
Reload the VS Code Python language server / window if imports still show as unresolved.
